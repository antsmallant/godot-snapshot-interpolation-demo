# Godot Networked Physics Demo (Work in Progress)

A simple networked physics demo for the Godot game engine.

## Todo
* Add documentation
* Fix interpolation for angles (i.e. smoothly interpolate a case like a1=340 and a2=0)
* More user-interface controls
* Fix bugs:
	- Division by zero in DelayBuffer
* Write UDP version
* Add dedicated server script
